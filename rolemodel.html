    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <hr><p><mark>Arunima Sinha was born in Ambedkar Nagar near Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh. Her father was in the Indian Army and her mother was a supervisor in the health department. She has an elder sister and a younger brother. After her father died, her mother tried to take care of her family.[10]</mark>
      Arunima liked football and also was a national volleyball player. She wanted to join the paramilitary forces. She got a call letter from the CISF and faced her life-changing accident while travelling to Delhi. <pre><b>Robbers snatched her bag and pushed her out of the running train. She fell on the track and was unable to move due to her severe injuries. A train coming from the opposite side ran over her leg below the knee. She was lying there for the whole night, 40 trains passed and no one helped. On the next day, the locals then took her to the hospital.[11][12]</p></pre></b>
      <h3>Train incident</h3><hr>
      <p>Sinha, a former national volleyball and football player,[5] boarded the Padmavati Express train at Lucknow for Delhi on 12 April 2011, to take an examination to join the CISF. She was pushed out of a general coach of the train by hooligans wanting to snatch her bag and gold chain for personal favours. Recounting the incident, she said:</p><br>

      <p>I resisted and they pushed me out of the train. I could not move. I remember seeing a train coming towards me. I tried getting up. By then, the train had run over my leg. I don't remember anything after that.<sup>[13]</sup><br>
        <p>Immediately, as she fell on the railway track, another train on a parallel track crushed her leg below the knee. She was rushed to the hospital[5] with serious leg and pelvic injuries and lost her leg after doctors amputated it to save her life.<sup>[14]</sup><br>

          She was offered compensation of ₹25,000 (US$310) by the Indian Sports Ministry. Following national outrage, the Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports Ajay Maken announced an additional Rs. ₹200,000 (US$2,500) compensation as medical relief, together with a recommendation for a job in the CISF. The Indian Railways also offered her a job.<sup>[15]</sup><br>
          
          On 18 April 2011, she was brought to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences<sup>[16]</sup> for further treatment, spending four months at the institute.<sup>[17]</sup> She was provided a prosthetic leg free of cost by a private Delhi-based Indian company.<sup>[18]</sup><br>
          
          An inquiry by the police into the incident threw her version of the accident into doubt. According to the police, she was either attempting suicide or met with an accident while crossing the railway tracks. Arunima claimed that the police were lying. Contrary to the police claims the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court ordered Indian Railways to pay a compensation of ₹500,000 (US$6,300) to Arunima Sinha.<sup>[19][20][21][22][23]</sup></p>
